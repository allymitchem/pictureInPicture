# Picture in Picture ðŸ“º

This application allows the user to select an open window or portion of their screen to capture and stream in a smaller window. Upon opening the application or refreshing the page, the user will be prompted to select which window or tab they would like to stream. Once selected, press the 'START' button to open a smaller viewing window with the selected media. 

Picture in Picture allows for multitasking if you want to watch a video while working on something else, or if you just want a music player or ambience video to be visible without taking over the entire screen.
