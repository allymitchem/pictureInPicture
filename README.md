# Picture in Picture ðŸ“º

This application allows the user to select an open window or portion of their screen to capture and stream in a smaller window. Upon opening the application or refreshing the page, the user will be prompted to select which window or tab they would like to stream. Once selected, press the 'START' button to open a smaller viewing window with the selected media. 

Picture in Picture enables multitasking by allowing users to enjoy ambient or instructional videos (including streamers) without monopolizing the entire screen.
